## ðŸš€ About the challenge


This will be an application to store repositories in your portfolio, which will allow the creation, listing, update and removal of repositories and, in addition, allow the repositories to receive "likes".


Application routes
Now that you have the template cloned, and ready to continue, you must open the app.js file, and complete where there is no code with the code to achieve the objectives of each route.

<ul>
<li><b>POST</b> / repositories: The route must receive title, url and techs within the body of the request, with the URL being the link to the github of this repository. When registering a new project, it must be stored inside an object in the following format: {id: "uuid", title: 'Desafio Node.js', url: 'http: //github.com / ...', techs: ["Node.js", "..."], likes: 0}; Make sure the ID is a UUID, and always start the likes as 0.</li>

<li><b>GET</b> / repositories: Route that lists all repositories;</li>

<li><b>PUT</b> / repositories /: id: The route should only change the title, url and techs of the repository that has the id equal to the id present in the route parameters;</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> / repositories /: id: The route must delete the repository with the id present in the route parameters;</li>

<li><b>POST</b> / repositories /: id / like: The route must increase the number of likes of the specific repository chosen through the id present in the route parameters, at each call of this route, the number of likes must be increased by 1;</li>
</ul>
Tip: Above we use POST in a route, even if it changes the number of likes in the repository without creating anything directly.

If we semantically divide the responsibilities of our application into entities, the like would be an entity, and the repository would be another entity.

With this separation, we have different business rules for each entity, so by calling the route like and adding just one, we can interpret that we are creating a new like, and not updating the likes.

So why not use PUT instead of POST? Precisely because we are "creating" A new like, and not updating the number of likes to any other value.

## Testing specification

In each test, you have a brief description of what your application must do in order for the test to pass.

If you have questions about what the tests are, and how to interpret them, take a look at our FAQ.

For this challenge we have the following tests:
<ul>
<li>should be able to create a new repository: For this test to pass, your application must allow a repository to be created, and return a json with the created project.</li>

<li>should be able to list the repositories: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow an array of all repositories that have been created so far to be returned.</li>

<li>should be able to update repository: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow only the url, title and techs fields to be changed.</li>

<li>should not be able to update a repository that does not exist: In order for this test to pass, you must validate in your update route whether the repository id sent by the url exists or not. If not, return an error with status 400.</li>

<li>should not be able to update repository likes manually: For this test to pass, you must not allow your update route to directly change the likes of that repository, maintaining the same number of likes that the repository already had before the update. That's because the only place that should update this information is the route responsible for increasing the number of likes.</li>

<li>should be able to delete the repository: In order for this test to pass, you must allow your delete route to delete a project, and when deleting it, it returns an empty response, with status 204.</li>

should not be able to delete a repository that does not exist: In order for this test to pass, you must validate on your delete route whether the repository id sent by the url exists or not. If not, return an error with status 400.

<li>should be able to give a like to the repository: For this test to pass, your application must allow a repository with the given id to receive likes. The value of likes must be increased by 1 with each request, and as a result, return a json containing the repository with the number of likes updated.</li>

<li>should not be able to like a repository that does not exist: In order for this test to pass, you must validate on your like route whether the repository id sent by the url exists or not. If not, return an error with status 400.</li>
<ul>
